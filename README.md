# 🛠️ Server Setup Guide

This folder should be created in the **same directory** as the `placement_portal` project.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
your-project/
├── placement_portal/
└── server/   ← you're here
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `server` folder:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   py -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🧰 Fixing Import Errors

If you run into any module import errors, manually install the missing package:

```bash
pip install <module_name>
```

## Relocate the ResumeUpload.jsx to the Pages/ folder

## ▶️ Running the Server

To start the Python server:

py app.py
```
